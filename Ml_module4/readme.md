🧠 Module-4: Classification Models
📁 GitHub Folder: ML-Module-4-Classification/
🎯 Goal: Classify if a patient has diabetes using ML models

📘 1. What is Classification?
Classification is a supervised learning technique where the target is categorical.

Model	Description
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)	Finds the 'k' closest samples
Support Vector Machine (SVM)	Draws a hyperplane to separate classes
Decision Tree	Rule-based decisions
Random Forest	Ensemble of decision trees for robustness

📊 2. Evaluation Metrics
Metric	Description
Accuracy	% of correct predictions
Confusion Matrix	Visualize TP, TN, FP, FN
Precision, Recall	For imbalanced data
ROC-AUC Curve	Overall model performance
